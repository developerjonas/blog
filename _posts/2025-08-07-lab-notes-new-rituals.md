Since the last few days, I’ve been experimenting with a new **morning ritual** — one that primes clarity, creativity, and courage before the world wakes up.

### 🔁 My Morning Flow (4 AM Start)

- **⚡️ Quick fresh-up**
- **💧 Boil & cool water for the day** — Clean mind = clean water = clean code.
- **📚 Deep reading for 2–3 hours (no screens)** — usually 1–2 chapters, handwritten notes.
- **🧘 Quiet review of dreams, journal entries, goals**

---

### 🌄 Why This Matters

This isn’t about hustle worship. It’s about **protecting the first light** of the day — that sacred time when distractions haven’t yet hijacked the mind.

In this space, I make decisions from **vision**, not urgency.

### ✍️ Lab Notes Reflections

- **I’m building not just projects, but the mind that will sustain them.**
- **Discipline is the architecture of impact.**
- **The earlier I wake, the clearer I think.**
