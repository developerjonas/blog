### 🧪 Observations & Insights

- **Global Reach, Real Impact**: Even with minimal promotion, nearly 400 unique people visited the site. This validates the hunger for quality, raw insights from a builder’s journey.
- **Caching Matters**: With only 38.6% of requests cached, there's room to fine-tune Cloudflare settings to reduce origin load and latency.
- **Next Steps**:
  - Optimize image delivery (enable WebP conversion).
  - Enable Brotli compression.
  - Fine-tune edge caching rules.

🧠 **What I Learned**

Every metric is a mirror. It doesn’t just reflect traffic — it reflects **engagement, curiosity, and the early heartbeat of a brand.**

I’ll continue posting these micro-milestones not for the numbers, but for the **narrative** behind them — proof that *impact starts with observation, not perfection.*

🧭 **Why I Share This**

This blog is my lab. It’s my open notebook. These analytics are **early feedback loops** — not validation, but **vibration**. And that’s enough to keep building.
