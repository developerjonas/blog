I didn’t just pass my final school exams.  
I learned differently — by doing, building, and understanding on my own terms.

---

## 🧪 Chemistry

I never studied it the usual way.  
No notes, no memorizing.  
I learned by watching videos like NileRed, understanding concepts intuitively, and connecting theory with practicals.

**Result:** A in theory, A+ in practical.

---

## 💻 Computer Science

I didn’t buy the class 12 book.  
Instead, I built a forum called **BrainOverflow** using vanilla PHP.  
I coded projects for nine friends and worked with Node.js while lessons were still basic JavaScript.

**Result:** A+ in both theory and practical.

## 🧲 Physics

Physics is a language I see in my mind’s eye.  
I visualized forces and systems through videos, labs, and raw curiosity.

**Result:** A in theory, A+ in practical.

---

## ➕ Mathematics

I failed math in grade 11.  
In grade 12, I bounced back by using Excel and Google Sheets for calculations.  
I even debated natural logs and integrals with my teacher for fun.

**Result:** B in theory, A+ in internal.

## 🌟 Final Thoughts

I never made notes or followed the traditional path.  
I trusted my own way of learning.  

This GPA is more than just a number — it’s proof that curiosity, self-learning, and boldness lead to success.
