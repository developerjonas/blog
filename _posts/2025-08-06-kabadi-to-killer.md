Everyone wants a Mac. I built mine from **scrap**.

I went to a local **scrap dealer**, pulled out an old computer nobody cared about, and decided:  
> _“I’ll make this my second brain.”_

No SSD. No fancy graphics. Just Linux and **brute force curiosity**.

I spent nights tweaking configurations, cleaning up bloated distros, removing unnecessary services, fine-tuning my kernel, and bringing it to a point where it felt **as smooth as my MacBook**.

People laughed. But now, I boot that kabadi machine, and it **boots my projects**.

It’s not about resources.  
It’s about **resourcefulness**.

🛠️ **What I Did:**
- Installed lightweight Linux (think Arch or Xubuntu)
- Removed GUI bloat, configured CLI tooling
- Tuned performance without SSD
- Used it for real coding, even deployed small servers

🧪 **Lab Note:**  
Innovation starts **where excuses end**.  
If you can build fire out of wet wood, you can build software out of scrap.
