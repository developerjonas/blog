> _"When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor."_ â€” **Elon Musk**

In Class 12, while others were flipping pages of the computer science textbook, I had already **ignored the book entirely.**  
Not out of arrogance, but because I was doing something far more alive: I was building with **Node.js**, while the classroom was still stuck on `document.write()`.

I never bought the textbook.  
I never made notes.  
I never revised a thing.

Instead, I **trusted my brain**, gave it the real-world stimulus it cravedâ€”errors, terminal logs, browser crashesâ€”and it gave me back clarity.  
I let my mind **live inside the logic**, not just learn about it.

Even in Mathematics, I remember **failing once**, but instead of shame, I found momentum.  
I once **cycled 15 kilometers under the blazing July sun** to buy the exact book I needed from Ratnapark.  
It wasnâ€™t disciplineâ€”it was **desperation with direction**.

ðŸ“Œ **Key Idea:**  
Not every syllabus fits every brain.  
If your curiosity works differently, **let it**. Thatâ€™s where breakthroughs begin.

ðŸ§ª **Lab Note:**  
Forget the mold. Find your mental metabolism. Thatâ€™s your real curriculum.
